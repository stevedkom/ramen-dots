# Opacity is changed between 0 and 1 by a Qtile hook on layout change. This
# is so that on max layout the background is visible and the bowl of ramen
# is out of the way of working in a terminal. However, in tiled mode we might have
# terminals right over the bowl and then it is hard to see the text so we change
# it to full opacity. Then picom takes care of inactive opacity so the main
# window has 100% opacity still and the inactive windows are somewhat see through.
# If the opacity line is changed much the hook might not work as it is just a
# simple sed call with a simple regex.
